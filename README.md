## We use GitHub flow, so all code changes happen through Pull Request

1. Fork the repository (repo) to your own GitHub account
2. Clone the project to your PC (Git)
3. Create a new branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Make changes (edit, delete, copy, add) on the new brach
5. Commit changes to the branch
6. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
7. Push changes to your fork (repo)
8. Open a Pull Request (PR) in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
9. Wait when your contribution will be accepted (merged) or declined to fix issues.

## Dealing with issues

Write issue reports with detail, background, and sample code

* A quick summary and/or background
* Steps to reproduce
    * Be specific!
    * Give sample code if you can. 
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens
* Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a consistent coding style

- 4 steps for indentation rather than tabs

## License

In short, when you submit code changes, you submissions are understood to be under the [Frontend_Mentor license](https://www.frontendmentor.io/license) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
